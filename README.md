# Delver40K
warhammer 40K mod for delver

# current features

* chain sword
* Storm bolter
* storm bolter ammmo
* power armor chestplate

everything is in a beta state.

gun.class is currently broken so storm bolter uses no ammo and is a  wand instead for the time being.

chain sword is missing sound effects and needs balancing

power armor needs a new sprite and the baseMods { moveSpeedMod: 5, hpMod: 10 } dont seem to be working
